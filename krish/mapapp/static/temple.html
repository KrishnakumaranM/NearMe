        The main deity, Samayapuram Mariamman, a form of Adi Parashakti and Mariamman, is made of sand and clay with extractions of medicinal herbs unlike many of the traditional stone idols and is considered as most powerful Goddess, and hence unlike many other Hindu deities there are no abhishekams (sacred bathing) conducted.
        One of the most significant pilgrimage places is Samayapuram Mariamman temple. It is one of the well-known temples to goddess Sakthi and it is where her followers worship her as Mariamman affectionately known as “samayapurathu Amma”
